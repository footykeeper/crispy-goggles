### footykeeper's main goal tracking app

Designed for football/soccer teams, this web app works with primarily Javascript. Made as a father-son project, it is designed for basic football/soccer game scoring and recording, as it will display a print-able table after the game is finished.

Currently in early beta phase, there are some bugs and it is going through major changes. In the future, users should be able to load previously saved rosters and look at past games.

## This is the downloadable version.

If you download it as a .zip file, it can be used offline.

### Warning: This version of footykeeper is outdated and lacks the support of the current version. This software may be bugged. It will still receive updates occaisionally, but it may never be as advanced as true online footykeeper.
