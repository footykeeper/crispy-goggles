### footykeeper's main goal tracking app

Designed for football/soccer teams, this web app works with primarily Javascript. Made as a father-son project, it is designed for basic football/soccer game scoring and recording, as it will display a print-able table after the game is finished.

Currently in early beta phase, there are some bugs and it is going through major changes. In the future, users should be able to load previously saved rosters and look at past games.
